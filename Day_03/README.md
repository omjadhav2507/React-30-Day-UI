React Email Validation Project

The "Email Validation" project is a React app focused on checking if an email is valid. Here's what I learned:


Handling Input: We use useState to keep track of what users type in the email input field.

Real-Time Updates: When users type, the app updates instantly thanks to the onChange event.

Dynamic Validation: The useEffect hook helps us check if the email is valid using a simple trick called a regular expression (emailRegex).

Feedback for Users: We show a green box for valid emails and a red one for invalid ones. This helps users know right away if their email is okay.
